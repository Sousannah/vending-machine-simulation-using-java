# Vending Machine Simulation

This Java program simulates a vending machine, allowing users to select items, deposit money, receive change, and view sales statistics. The program is implemented using structured programming paradigms without utilizing object-oriented concepts.

## Program Overview

The program is structured around the main method, which orchestrates the vending machine operations. Functionality is modularized into separate functions to enhance clarity and maintainability. User interaction is facilitated through console input and output.

## Functionality

- **Vending Machine Operations**: Users can activate the vending machine, select items from the menu, deposit money, and receive products and change.
